gdb level5
(gdb)layout asm

we observe that there is a function o() that is not called.
since there is a printf we can assume that this is another format string attack. 
echo "%x" | ./level5 => BINGO!

python -c 'print "AAAA" + "%x-" * 100' | ./level5
the offset of the string is the 4th element.

so now we try to replace the address of exit in the G.O.T by the address of o function.
(see the script)
