Starting by using ltrace on our program :
	we see that our program expect to use atoi on argv[1]
	and that if the number is < 10 there is a memcpy

at first i tought that i had to use some weird overflows then i realized that there is a check for the value at the end of the function:

the value passed to memcpy is mult by sizeof(int)
so if the value mult by 4 is an integer overflow we can exploit it so i tried to find the size of the buffer we want to exploit.

That is 40 and thats where we want our offset to be to rewrite our integer to satisfy the value of our integer and
start a shell so our payload is :

./bonus1 -1073741813 "AAAABBBBCCCCDDDDEEEEFFFF0000111122223333FLOW5555666677778888"
