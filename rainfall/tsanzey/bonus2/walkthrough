At first we can see that it needs 2 argument so naively we try somtheing like that :
./bonu1 `python -c 'print "AAAA" * 50'` `python -c 'print "BBBB" * 50'`

We can see that there is a segmentation fault. So i decided to investigate into gdb:

signal SIGSEGV received at 0x8004242
damn we can only control one part of the EIP;
and since there is a limit into the 2 strncpy it means that we cannot go further into memory.

What can i do ?
By looking into the greetuser function we can see that there is a strcat that isn't secured and i changes the greeting message depending on our LANG env function.
There is nl and fi comp in the memcmp from the main function and the result is used as a parameter in the greetuser function if we can get a larger string that "Hello " we may be able to go further into memory and get full control of the EIP.

lets try that again:
export LANG=fi

signal SIGSEGV received at 0x42424242
Boom !!!

now we just have to write a classic shellcode inject it into the ENV and call its address
